# Project 3
## Time Piece
### The Curfew Clock
 
For those who don’t know, I was born and raised in Chile and haven’t been able to focus in the past days due to this. 

Following my last project, I wanted to explore the 24/7 capitalist urge to keep lights on to produce nonstop. I looked at sundials and wondered how they worked in zones above the arctic pole where the sun moves horizontally. I came across a 24 hour watch that makes total sense to have if you live there (in a store called “Svalbard”). I did a couple of timelapse at night and was about to take a diy sundial outside to keep on experimenting. 

But then this happen. Last friday an organized massive evasion of public transportation happened due to the increase of fares and the suggestion of one of the minister to “wake up earlier to avoid peak hour”. This escalated very quickly and at night there were multiple metro stations, buildings, and streets on fire. On Saturday people didn’t stop and at night, a state of emergency was declared. Couple of hours later when the situation got worse, they set curfew. At 12 everybody should remain at home or risk being arrested, shot or disappear. Just like the dictatorship period from 1973 to 1990. Last night was the fourth night of curfew not only in the capital city but across the country.

Not because of $30 pesos, but because 30 years of a neoliberalist constitution. People, including myself are fed up with the government and every politician, from every party. We might be one of the most “prosperous”, “growing” and safe country of Latin America, but those numbers just point to that 1% who believe a country can be managed as a firm.  

So I’m proposing a product for that percentage of people. As a way of giving returning the years of torture and humiliation to the ones that are to blame. In this case, the shock doctrine represented by a curfew alarm which will keep you awake and aware during these hours.

It is a digital 24hr clock that only works during the “free” time. When curfew comes, it blurs out and there is no way of counting the minutes of the confinement.
