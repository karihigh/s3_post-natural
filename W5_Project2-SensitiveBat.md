## Measuring Device
### Sensitive Bat

This measuring device consists of a wall mounted bat that will scream when the light levels are way higher than they can resist. Nocturnal animals are the kind of species that are affected by badly designed lamp posts, overly illuminated buildings or trees and every artificial light that shines or reflects upwards.

Taking into account the many kinds of pollution that are making our lives more difficult and driving us towards extinction, I was particularly interested in light pollution. **It is a very visible one, but rather unseen.** I used to go to the countryside for Christmas when I was a kid. And every year, that night I was able to see thousands of stars. Back then I thought it was part of the magic of Santa Claus, sledges and reindeers. As I grew up, I learnt that in the city, the lights that keeps us safe at night in the streets are also the reason why we can’t distinguish many constellations anymore. Now all we can see when we look up in a big city is a very slow but frequent shooting star, a.k.a. Airplanes.

Maps of the world showing satellite information about the light levels are very interesting to see the “god’s” view of the earth at night. But what these maps show is the amount of light that shines up into the sky and messes with astronomers and others interested in viewing the galaxy. But what happens with the rest of us who can’t see that view and we are subject to the eye-level light pollution. So I started by using a light sensor that measures the luminous emittance of the environment.

 I chose one that could be easily paired with a Raspberry Pi so that I could make a wireless device that could move and make measurements in different spaces. How does the light change when measured on the ground or from a 10th floor of a building (somewhere the standard lamp post height). When I achieved a constant reading from the sensor I thought of ways to show the data that didn’t include any source of light, since it would be counterproductive.
